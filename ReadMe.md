# IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. By categorizing each review as either positive or negative, the model helps to derive insights into audience sentiments. This repository contains all the necessary code, datasets, and explanations to demonstrate the end-to-end process of data preparation, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model that can classify movie reviews as positive or negative.
- Use advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to prepare the dataset.
- Evaluate multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and CatBoost, to identify the best-performing approach.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is the IMDB movie reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 reviews labeled as either positive or negative. It is a balanced dataset, with an equal number of positive and negative sentiments, providing an unbiased foundation for training the model. The reviews are text-based, with varying length and complexity, making it a good challenge for developing robust NLP models.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Understanding and Preprocessing**: The data was first loaded and explored to understand its characteristics. Key preprocessing steps included removing HTML tags, converting text to lowercase, removing outliers, and lemmatizing the text to create a clean dataset for analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Text data was transformed using two main vectorization techniquesâ€”Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF. Additionally, features such as review length, sentiment word count, and punctuation statistics were created to provide more context for model training.

3. **Modeling and Evaluation**: Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and CatBoost Classifier. The models were assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with the CatBoost model showing the best performance.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The CatBoost model was further optimized using GridSearchCV to identify the best parameters, leading to improved accuracy and a more reliable model.

5. **Deployment**: The best-performing model was deployed using Streamlit to provide an easy-to-use interface for predicting the sentiment of movie reviews. Users can either input a single review or upload a CSV file for batch predictions.
